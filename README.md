# Restaurant Review Map

The Restaurant Review Map is a web application that allows users to explore and review restaurants on a map. It provides a user-friendly interface to discover new dining places, read and leave reviews, and filter restaurants based on their ratings.

## Features

### Interactive Map

- The map is powered by the Google Maps JavaScript API.
- Users can click on the map to add new restaurants.
- Markers represent restaurants on the map.

### Restaurant Listings

- Restaurants are listed on the left-hand side of the map.
- Each restaurant listing displays the restaurant's name, average rating, and a photo.
- Users can click on a restaurant listing to view more details about the restaurant.

### Filtering

- Users can filter restaurants by rating using a slider.
- The slider allows users to specify a minimum and maximum rating, and the map updates to display only the restaurants that fall within the selected rating range.

### Adding Reviews

- To add a new restaurant and review, users can click anywhere on the map.
- A prompt dialog asks for the restaurant's name, user rating (from 1 to 5 stars), and a review/comment.
- The new restaurant is added as a marker on the map.
- User reviews are displayed on the map and in the restaurant details.

### Viewing Restaurant Details

- Users can click on a restaurant marker on the map to view its details.
- Restaurant details include the name, average rating, and user reviews.
- Users can read existing reviews and add new reviews for the selected restaurant.
